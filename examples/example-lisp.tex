\section{create a latex document from lisp }

in this document we show how to create an entire latex document from lisp. it is recommended to use org-mode instead. 
 
\section{Using strings}

Strings can be used if you prefer, and if you want to use commas and have 
case-sensitivity. Perhaps it is more convenient not to use tex-eval-list on the entire document, but only on the important parts.
Since I don't really use this workflow personally, I am not sure :)
